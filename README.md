# codealpha_tasks
This repository shows the machine learning tasks for CodeAlpha remote internship.

It's classified to four different tasks:

1-Credit Scoring Model:
  Predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
  financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and assess the
  model's accuracy.
2-Emotion Recognition from Speech:
  Model that can recognize emotions in speech
  audio. Deep learning and speech processing
  techniques used to classify spoken sentences into different
  emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness. 
3-Handwritten Character Recognition:
  Handwritten character recognition system that
  can recognize various handwritten characters or
  alphabets. 
4-Disease Prediction from Medical Data:
  Model to predict the likelihood of a disease
  based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient
  history). Use datasets with labeled medical records and
  apply classification algorithms.
